1. Introduction
Purpose:
  This document defines the test plan for the Cab Aggregator System v1.0. It outlines objectives, scope, strategy, resources, schedule, and responsibilities for testing.
Scope:
  Testing covers web-based cab aggregator features such as secure login, ride booking, driver assignment, fare estimation, payments, ride tracking, notifications, and ride history. Out of scope: third-party payment processor internals, map API algorithms, and telecom infrastructure.
References:
* SRS for Cab Aggregator System v1.0
* Design Specs v1.0
* PSP compliance docs
* Data Privacy guidelines

2. Test Items
* User Registration & Authentication module
* Ride Booking module
* Driver Module (availability, ride acceptance)
* Fare Calculation & Payment module
* Ride Tracking (map-based)
* Notifications system
* Ride History
3. Features to be Tested
Functional:
* CAB-F-001: Secure Registration & Login
* CAB-F-002: Ride Booking (pickup/drop)
* CAB-F-003: Match Rider with Nearby Driver
* CAB-F-004: Display Fare Estimate
* CAB-F-005: Group Ride option
* CAB-F-006: Payments via PSP
* CAB-F-007: Driver Availability toggle
* CAB-F-008: Live Ride Tracking
* CAB-F-009: Ride History
Non-functional:
* CAB-NF-001: Response time = 10s
* CAB-NF-002: AES-256 encryption
* CAB-NF-003: Handle = 2 concurrent users (demo)
* CAB-NF-004: Chrome browser compatibility
* CAB-NF-005: PSP compliance
* CAB-NF-006: Map refresh = 10s
Security:
* CAB-SR-001   TLS 1.2+ for all connections  
* CAB-SR-002   Passwords stored with salted hashing  
* CAB-SR-003   Auth tokens (e.g., JWT) for sessions  
* CAB-SR-004   Secure, validated forms for sensitive inputs
4. Features Not to be Tested
* Third-party payment processor internals
* Map API accuracy (routing algorithms)
* Telecom/SMS delivery by provider
5. Test Approach / Strategy
Levels:
* Unit Tests (modules: auth, booking, payment)
* Integration Tests (Rider ? Driver ? Payment)
* System Tests (end-to-end booking flow)
* Acceptance Tests (UAT with demo users)
Types:
* Functional testing
* Regression testing
* Performance testing (response =10s, load with 2 users)
* Security testing (OTP, encryption, input validation)
* Usability testing (web UI on Chrome)
Entry Criteria: Stable build, test data ready, environment up.
 Exit Criteria: 100% test cases executed, 0 critical defects, acceptance criteria met
5.1 Security Validation
* TLS 1.2+ enforced
* Password hashing (bcrypt/argon2)
* OTP login and trip start verification
* JWT-based session management
* SQLi/XSS penetration testing

6. Test Environment
Hardware: Laptops/desktops with Chrome browser
Software: Cab Aggregator v1.0, Test DB, mock PSP, mock Maps API
 Tools: Postman (API testing), Selenium (UI)
 Test Data: Dummy users (riders/drivers), trips, payments
7. Test Schedule
Milestones:
* Test case design: 18-Sep-2025
* Environment setup: 20-Sep-2025
* Test execution starts: 21-Sep-2025
* Test execution end: 05-Oct-2025
* UAT: 07-Oct-2025 to 10-Oct-2025

9. Roles and Responsibilities
RoleNameResponsibilityQA LeadChinthan KPrepare plan, coordinate executionTest EngineerChristananda BDesign & execute test cases, log defectsDeveloperChethan SSupport defect fixes and triageProduct OwnerDevraj Ishwar NaikApprove test results, sign-off readiness10. Risks and Mitigation
RiskMitigationDelay in stable build deliveryCoordinate with development team for early build availability; maintain backup build; prioritize critical modules first.Incomplete or inconsistent test dataPrepare comprehensive dummy data sets for riders, drivers, trips, and payments; validate test data before executionThird-party PSP or Maps API downtimeUse mock PSP and mock Maps API for testing; maintain fallback procedures for integration tests.11. Assumptions & Dependencies
* Stable Test Environment Availability 
* Complete & Approved Requirements  
* Third-Party Services Availability  
12. Suspension & Resumption Criteria
* Suspend testing if:
* Critical Build Failures
* Environment/Infrastructure Unavailability
* Resume testing if:
* Blocking defects are resolved
* Environment Restored
13. Test Case Management & Traceability
RTM ensures mapping of SRS requirements to test cases.
