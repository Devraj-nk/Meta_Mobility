1. Introduction
1.1 Purpose
This document specifies the Software Requirements for a Web-based Cab Aggregator System ("the System"), similar in concept to Ola/Uber but implemented primarily as a web app. It defines functional and non-functional requirements, external interfaces, constraints, and verification criteria for stakeholders including engineering, QA, product, and operations.
1.2 Scope
The System enables Riders to request on-demand trips, Drivers to accept and fulfill trips, and Admin/Operations to monitor marketplace health—all through a responsive web application. It covers rider/driver web portals, trip lifecycle management, pricing and payments, and a management console. Out of scope: third-party payment processor internals, telecom provider infrastructure, and any offline fleet management not integrated via APIs.
1.3 Audience
•	Developers & QA: implement and test the web app.
•	Operations/Admin Teams: monitor and manage users, trips, and payments.
•	Instructors/Evaluators: assess design and implementation.
•	End-Users: Riders and Drivers accessing the platform via web browsers.
1.4 Definitions & Acronyms
•	Rider: End user booking a trip.
•	Driver/Partner: Verified driver accepting trips.
•	ETA: Estimated Time of Arrival.
•	KYC: Know Your Customer (identity verification).
•	OTP: One-Time Password (trip start or login verification).
•	PSP: Payment Service Provider / Gateway.

2. Overall Description
2.1 Product Perspective
The System is a responsive web application consisting of:
•	Rider Portal: Trip booking, live tracking, payments, and feedback.
•	Driver Portal: Trip requests, navigation info, earnings, and status management.
•	Third-Party Integrations: Maps, payment gateways, SMS/email providers.
2.2 Major Product Functions
•	Account & Identity: Web sign-up/login (email/phone OTP), KYC for drivers, profile management.
•	Ride Booking & Matching: Pickup/drop selection, fare estimate, ride confirmation, driver assignment.
•	Group Rides: Riders traveling in the same direction can share a cab, reducing costs and carbon footprint.
•	Navigation & Trip Lifecycle: Map-based navigation (via integration), OTP-based trip start, live trip status, trip completion.
•	Payments: Fare estimate, card/UPI/cash options.
•	Safety: SOS button (web shortcut), share-trip via link, call masking.
•	Feedback: Ratings, reviews, trip issue reporting.
•	Support: Web help center, dispute submission, admin responses.
•	Driver Operations: Online/offline toggle, trip acceptance, earnings dashboard.
2.3 User Roles and Characteristics
•	Rider: Web-savvy expects easy booking, transparent pricing, and reliable service. May also be motivated by eco-friendly or cost-sharing options like group rides.
•	Driver/Partner: Needs simple trip acceptance, basic navigation, and earnings visibility. Motivated by gamified incentives.
2.4 Operating Environment
•	Web Browsers: Chrome.
•	Backend: Cloud-hosted server with REST APIs, relational DB.
•	Network: Requires internet connectivity; handle low bandwidth with graceful fallbacks, including a basic offline booking queue that stores requests and processes them when connectivity returns.
2.5 Constraints
•	Security: HTTPS/TLS 1.2+, password hashing, OTP verification.
•	Payments: Integration with PSPs; avoid storing sensitive card details.
•	Data Privacy: Compliance with basic data protection regulations.
•	Scalability: Should handle moderate concurrent users (student scale).
•	Novelty Constraints: Innovative yet feasible features like group rides, gamification, and chatbot support must remain lightweight and achievable for a student project.

3. External Interface Requirements

•	Post-trip: Receipt, feedback form.
Driver Web App
•	Login status.
•	Online/Offline toggle.
•	Trip request popup with accept/reject.
•	Simple map preview and route instructions (via integration).
•	Earnings summary page with gamification badges.
3.2 Hardware Interfaces
•	User Devices: Desktop/laptop browser.
•	Server: local machine for testing.
3.3 Software Interfaces
•	Maps API: Geocoding, routing, ETA calculation.
•	Payment Gateway: Transaction authorization and refunds.
•	Messaging Services: Email/SMS for OTP and notifications.
•	Database: Relational DB for user/trip storage.
3.4 Communications
•	Protocols: HTTPS/TLS 1.2+.
•	Data Format: JSON over REST APIs.
•	Real-Time Updates: Web Sockets or polling for trip status.
•	Resilience: Basic retry for failed requests; offline booking queue for temporary connectivity loss.
